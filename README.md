# international-debt

The goal of this project is to analyze the structure of the world external debt country-wise and the structure of each country external debt creditor-wise. Below you can find SQL queries generating reports that are used in Tableau dashbord.

First, I am looking through the database to get familiar with the dataset, then I check dataset cleanliness, and finally writing SQL queries.
